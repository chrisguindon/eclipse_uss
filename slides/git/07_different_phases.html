<ul>
<li><strong>Untracked</strong> – data is not known to Git</li>
<li><strong>Unmodified</strong> – you did nothing</li>
<li><strong>Modified</strong> – you changed something</li>
<li><strong>Staged</strong> – you prepared for a commit</li>
<li><strong>Committed</strong> – you made changes permanent</li>
<li><strong>Pushed</strong> – you shared your changes</li>
</ul>
<p>You have to tell Git that you want a file to be included in the next
commit. Git is opt-in!</p>

<p>The "thing"" where Git keeps your soon to be committed data is called
the staging area.</p>
