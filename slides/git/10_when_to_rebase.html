  <h2 class="funky-title">When to Merge vs. When to Rebase</h2>

<h2>Merging</h2>
<p>After you have finished implementing a new feature on a branch and
you want to bring that new feature into the main branch.</p>

<p><strong>Rebase:</strong> is a way to "merge" 
another branch into the branch where you are currently working,
 and move all of the local commits that are ahead of the rebased 
 branch to the top of the history on that branch.</p>
